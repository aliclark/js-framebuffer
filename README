This project emulates a framebuffer in Javascript.

Could be useful if you intend to develop/test framebuffer output code in a high level language that cannot yet compile to native code but which can or will soon be able to compile to Javascript.

Or if you're just into this sort of thing...

Please see test.html for an example
